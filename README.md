## My process

### Built with

- Semantic HTML5 markup
- SCSS
- Flexbox
- CSS Grid
- Desktop-first workflow
- No frameworks used.

### What I learned

Almost in every part of the application, I used CSS grid layout. Area property of grid is really powerful and can be applied everywhere. In VanillaJS, handling state can be a little bit difficult, but I managed it anyway.

### Continued development

A popup menu can be shown when user clicks three dots, but I think the application is enough for now.
